# QUICK FIX GUIDE - PostgreSQL Migration

## ✅ Issues Fixed:
1. ✅ Replaced all `pool.execute` with `pool.query` 
2. ⚠️ Need to handle query result format differences

## Key Difference Between MySQL2 and PG:

### MySQL2:
```javascript
const [rows] = await pool.execute('SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ?', [1]);
// rows is the data array
```

### PostgreSQL (pg):
```javascript
const result = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = $1', [1]);
const rows = result.rows; // Need to access .rows property
```

## Immediate Fix Needed:

All queries need to:
1. Use `pool.query` instead of `pool.execute` ✅ DONE
2. Change `?` to `$1, $2, $3` etc.
3. Access `result.rows` instead of destructuring

## Quick Test:

Run this to verify database connection:
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/test-postgresql.js
```

Then start the server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## If you still get errors:

The application will need a complete query refactor. I recommend:
1. Using Drizzle ORM (already set up) instead of raw SQL
2. Or creating a wrapper function to handle query differences

Would you like me to:
A) Create a wrapper function for backward compatibility
B) Help migrate to Drizzle ORM completely
C) Continue fixing queries manually (will take time)
