## üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### What Was Actually Happening?

Your codebase had **4 different `vercel.json` files**, each with different configurations using the **deprecated Vercel v2 Build API** (`builds` and `routes` properties). Here's what was going wrong:

#### **The Broken Configuration:**
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "frontend/package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "build" }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

#### **Why This Failed:**

1. **Deprecated API**: The `builds` property is from Vercel's v2 platform (circa 2019-2020), which has been superseded
2. **Complex Build Process**: The v2 API tried to build from `frontend/package.json` but couldn't properly resolve the paths
3. **Multiple Config Files**: Having 4 different vercel config files caused ambiguity about which configuration to use
4. **Missing Deployment Artifacts**: When Vercel couldn't build properly, it either:
   - Failed to create the deployment entirely
   - Created a partial deployment that was later garbage collected
   - Generated a deployment ID that never had valid artifacts

### What Triggers DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND?

This error occurs when:

1. **Deployment URL exists but content doesn't**: Vercel created a deployment ID, but the build failed, so there are no files to serve
2. **Garbage Collection**: Old/failed deployments get cleaned up, but URLs may still reference them
3. **Configuration Mismatch**: Your config points to paths that don't exist in the deployment
4. **Build Failure**: The deployment process fails silently, creating an empty deployment

### The Misconception

**Common Misunderstanding**: "Vercel will automatically figure out how to build my monorepo with nested projects"

**Reality**: Vercel needs explicit instructions on:
- Where your buildable code is (`outputDirectory`)
- How to build it (`buildCommand`)
- What dependencies to install (`installCommand`)
- How to route requests (`rewrites` for SPAs)

The `builds` API was an early attempt at this, but it was too complex and had edge cases like yours.

## üìö CONCEPT: Modern Vercel Deployment Model

### The Mental Model

Think of Vercel deployments in 3 phases:

```
1. INSTALL ‚Üí 2. BUILD ‚Üí 3. DEPLOY
   ‚Üì              ‚Üì           ‚Üì
Dependencies   Output Dir   Serve Files
```

#### **Modern Configuration (What We Implemented):**
```json
{
  "installCommand": "npm install --prefix frontend",
  "buildCommand": "cd frontend && npm install && npm run build", 
  "outputDirectory": "frontend/build",
  "framework": null,
  "rewrites": [...]
}
```

### Why This Exists (The Protection)

The DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND error is Vercel's way of saying:
> "I couldn't find valid artifacts at this deployment URL"

**It protects you from:**
- Serving broken/incomplete applications
- CDN cache poisoning with invalid content
- Resource wastage on failed deployments
- Silent failures that could break production

**Vercel's Philosophy**: 
- **Fail Fast**: Better to show DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND than serve a broken app
- **Immutable Deployments**: Each deployment is atomic‚Äîit either exists completely or not at all
- **Zero Downtime**: Old deployments stay live until new ones are confirmed working

### Framework Design Principles

**Old Way (v2 Builds API):**
```
[Source Code] ‚Üí [Build Spec] ‚Üí [Custom Builder] ‚Üí [Lambdas + Static Files]
                  ‚Üë Complex!
```
- Flexible but complex
- Required understanding of builders
- Hard to debug
- Many edge cases

**New Way (Direct Build Commands):**
```
[Source Code] ‚Üí [Your Build Command] ‚Üí [Output Directory] ‚Üí [Deploy]
                  ‚Üë Simple!
```
- Explicit and predictable
- Uses your existing build process
- Easy to debug locally
- Framework-agnostic

## üö® WARNING SIGNS: How to Recognize This Pattern

### Red Flags in Configuration:

1. **Using `version: 2` and `builds` in vercel.json**
   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,  // ‚ö†Ô∏è Outdated
     "builds": [...] // ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated
   }
   ```

2. **Multiple vercel config files** (vercel.json, vercel-frontend.json, etc.)
   - Vercel only reads ONE `vercel.json` from project root
   - Multiple files = configuration conflict

3. **Complex `src` paths in builds**
   ```json
   "builds": [{ "src": "frontend/package.json" }] // ‚ö†Ô∏è Fragile
   ```

4. **Using `@vercel/static-build` with monorepos**
   - Works for simple cases
   - Breaks with nested dependencies

5. **Deployment succeeds but shows DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND**
   - Build appears successful in logs
   - But no content is actually deployed
   - Indicates output directory mismatch

### Similar Mistakes in Related Scenarios:

1. **Netlify**: Using `publish` directory that doesn't exist
2. **GitHub Pages**: Building to wrong directory (e.g., `dist` vs `build`)
3. **Docker**: `COPY` from path that doesn't exist in build context
4. **CDN**: Pointing to S3 bucket with wrong permissions

### Code Smells:

```javascript
// In package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "vercel-build": "npm run build" // ‚ö†Ô∏è Where does it run?
  }
}
```

**Problem**: Doesn't specify working directory for monorepo structure

**Fix**: Be explicit in vercel.json instead:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd frontend && npm run build"
}
```

## üéØ ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES & TRADE-OFFS

### Approach 1: Single vercel.json (‚úÖ Recommended - What We Did)

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd frontend && npm install && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "frontend/build",
  "installCommand": "npm install --prefix frontend"
}
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Simple and explicit
- ‚úÖ Easy to debug (run commands locally)
- ‚úÖ Works with any build tool
- ‚úÖ Framework-agnostic

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Must specify full paths
- ‚ùå No automatic framework detection

**Best for:** Monorepos, custom build processes, explicit control

---

### Approach 2: Deploy from Frontend Directory Only

**Setup:** Deploy the `frontend` folder as a separate Vercel project

**Configuration (place in `frontend/vercel.json`):**
```json
{
  "framework": "create-react-app",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "build"
}
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Automatic framework detection
- ‚úÖ Simpler configuration
- ‚úÖ Cleaner separation of concerns

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Requires deploying from subdirectory
- ‚ùå Need to manage multiple projects if you have backend too

**Best for:** When frontend and backend are completely separate

---

### Approach 3: Using Vercel's Framework Preset

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "framework": "create-react-app",
  "buildCommand": "cd frontend && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "frontend/build"
}
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Leverages Vercel's optimizations
- ‚úÖ Automatic caching strategies
- ‚úÖ Framework-specific improvements

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Less control over build process
- ‚ùå Must match framework expectations

**Best for:** Standard Create React App setups

---

### Approach 4: Old v2 Builds API (‚ùå Not Recommended)

**Why it exists:** Legacy projects, complex multi-service deployments

**When to use:** Never for new projects. Only if:
- You have an existing v2 config that works
- You're deploying a complex multi-service architecture
- You need custom runtime configuration

**Migration path:** Vercel recommends moving away from this

---

## üõ°Ô∏è PREVENTION CHECKLIST

Before deploying to Vercel, verify:

- [ ] **One configuration file**: Only `vercel.json` in project root
- [ ] **Build locally first**: Run your build command and verify output
  ```bash
  cd frontend && npm run build
  # Check that frontend/build exists and has files
  ```
- [ ] **Output directory exists**: The path in `outputDirectory` must contain an `index.html`
- [ ] **Paths are correct**: All commands use correct relative paths
- [ ] **No deprecated properties**: No `builds`, `routes`, or `version: 2`
- [ ] **Framework specified**: Set `framework` or use `null` for manual control

### Testing Your Configuration Locally:

```bash
# 1. Clean slate
rm -rf frontend/build frontend/node_modules

# 2. Run install command (from project root)
npm install --prefix frontend

# 3. Run build command (from project root)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build

# 4. Verify output
ls -la frontend/build/index.html  # Should exist

# 5. Test serving locally
cd frontend/build && npx serve -s .
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

If this works locally, it will work on Vercel.

- [Monorepos](https://vercel.com/docs/monorepos)
- [Create React App Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/create-react-app)

### Understanding the Error:
- [DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND](https://vercel.com/docs/errors/DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND)
  - Occurs when deployment ID exists but has no content
  - Usually from failed builds or deleted deployments
  - Check build logs for actual errors

### Build API Evolution:
- **v1** (2018): Simple static deployments
- **v2** (2019): Builds API with custom builders ‚Üê You were here
- **v3** (2022+): Direct build commands ‚Üê We moved you here

---

## üéì KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Modern Vercel = Simple Build Commands**: Just tell Vercel how to build, where output is
2. **One Config File**: Multiple vercel.json files cause conflicts
3. **Test Locally First**: Your build command should work locally before deploying
4. **DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND = Missing Artifacts**: Build succeeded but output directory is wrong/empty
5. **Explicit > Implicit**: Don't rely on Vercel auto-detection with monorepos

---

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION

After pushing your changes, verify the deployment:

1. **Check build logs** in Vercel dashboard
   - Should show: "Building frontend..."
   - Should show: "Build completed"
   - Should show: "Deploying to production..."

2. **Visit your deployment URL**
   - Should load your React app
   - Should NOT show DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND

3. **Check deployment settings** in Vercel dashboard
   - Build Command: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `frontend/build`
   - Install Command: `npm install --prefix frontend`

---

## üÜò STILL HAVING ISSUES?

If you still see DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND after applying this fix:

1. **Clear Vercel build cache**:
   - Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Clear Build Cache

2. **Check for errors in build logs**:
   - Look for actual build failures (not just DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND)

3. **Verify frontend/build exists after local build**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run build && ls -la build/
   ```

4. **Try deploying from frontend directory directly**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   vercel
   ```

5. **Check environment variables** (if your app needs them):
   - Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
